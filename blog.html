            <p>
                If you're new to meditation, it's essential to start with short sessions and gradually
                increase the duration as you become more comfortable with the practice. Here are some tips to
                help you get started:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Find a quiet and comfortable place to sit or lie down.</li>
                <li>Close your eyes and focus on your breath or a specific point of concentration.</li>
                <li>Observe your thoughts without judgment and gently redirect your focus to the present moment.</li>
                <li>Start with just a few minutes and gradually increase the time as you progress.</li>
                <li>Consider using guided meditation apps or videos to help you stay on track.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>

                most important thing is to be consistent and patient with yourself as you develop your
                practice.
